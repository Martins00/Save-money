This project is one I intend using to practice my HTML, plain CSS and JavaScript. I decided to use plain CSS, because I have been using TailwindCss a lot. I just wanted to be sure I still had it. 

I'd been taking courses on UX design, so I'd not been coding much. In order to makes sure I was not forgetting my skills, I reached out to a friend to work on a design so I could develop. She came up with this "SaveMoney". 
I have a lot of things I am working on currently, so I am taking this really slow. 

On posting this on my github, I have only done the web version. I will be working on the Responsiveness and interactions(JavaScript) subsequently.
